  Other classes may require you to do this. Spend your time wisely.
* Poster presentation: ???? Ask Lamara and let me know 
* I added a column pyton to make sure that you review the python features as we will use them in the project. You may need to set some time asside for it. If you are familiar with the concepts, let me know and we can do other things. Remember that what we do in python is just a refreser and you should know it. Adding it here will guide you on what you should already know. The cloudmesh activities are in addition, but trivial. The will safe you hours upon hours of work. 

Please check dates and correct if you see mistakes
